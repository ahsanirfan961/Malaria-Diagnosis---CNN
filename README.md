# Malaria Diagnosis Classification Model with TensorFlow

Welcome to the Malaria Diagnosis Classification Model project! This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow to classify whether single-cell images from thin smear blood samples are parasitized or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from TensorFlowâ€™s own dataset of malaria. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/malaria).

## Example Images

Below are examples of an infected cell and an uninfected cell:

### Infected Cell

### Uninfected Cell
![Uninfected Cell](images/uninfected.png)

## Model Architecture

The model is built using convolutional layers with ReLU activation and a final sigmoid activation for classification. The architecture of the model is shown below:

### Key Layers:

- **Input Layer:** Takes in images of size 224x224 with 3 color channels (RGB).
- **Convolutional Layers:** Two convolutional layers with filters of size 3x3, followed by Batch Normalization and Max Pooling layers.
- **Dense Layers:** Three dense layers, with the final layer using a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Training Performance

The model is trained for 20 epochs. Below are the plots showing the decrease in loss and increase in accuracy over the training epochs:
